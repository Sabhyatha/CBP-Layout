      <h2>Livorna Tour</h2>
        <p>During the Renaissance, Livorno was designed as an "Ideal town". Developing considerably from the second half of the 16th century by the will of the Medici family, Livorno was an important free port, giving rise to an intense commercial activity, in the hands, for the most part, of foreigners, and seat of consulates and shipping companies. The status of a multiethnic and multicultural Livorno lasted until the second half of the nineteenth century, however the vestiges of that time can still be seen in the churches, villas and palaces of the city.</p><br><br>

        <h3>About us</h3>
        Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.
